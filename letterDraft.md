Doctor: Hello Mr. Reeds. I am Brittany. I am glad you decided to call me. Before we talk any further, I would like to advise you to not jump to any conclusions and let us keep this conversation only as consulation.

Micheal R.: Thank you doc. That sounds comforting but seeing her condition, I doubt the conversation can be in the same state.

Doctor: Alright, so tell me what is her problem.

Micheal R.: She has her head completely in the clouds! Or so I thought... She would imagine things that were not even there. At first I and my wife, Ella thought it was all for seeking our attention since we are so caught up in our work, but after one year things started getting serious. We have a baby camera in the playroom and we saw that she would scream at the shadows made by a curtain and run away from a ball.

One day, Ella decided to confront her about it. She went when she started screaming at the shadows. When Ella interrogated her for such an unacceptable behaivour as the oldest child of the Reeds family, she said that the shadows pitied her existance, laughed at her for being weak, and scolded her for thinking she deserves a lavish lifestyle.

That is not it. During our meals together, she would scream at her food because they would come to life. She would see shadows behind me, Ella, and crystal, my younger daughter who would try to choke us. After balling her eyes out, she would suddenly go back to normal and continue with her meal. All of us are very concerned doctor... please fix my baby girl...

Doctor: I understand your concern Mr. Reeds but what you are saying sounds a lot like Dilusional disorder. But I am going to need to talk to her myself. You previously mentioned that you had suddenly boomed your business... do you think it might be related to-

Micheal R.: Please. I'm sure you're mistaken. We maintain a very pleasant environment at home. Our daughters have beautiful two daughters who are very well educated and voluntarily read all the books in the house. There is absolutely nothing wrong in that aspect of our lives.

Doctor: R-right. Im sorry Mr. Reeds. The public image of your family is exceptional. Nevertheless, I will need to talk to her personally.

Micheal R.: Thank you and its fine. I must really get to a meeting so let us end the consultance here. I will contact you when MC is free from her studies.

Doctor: ... . But of course... sir. When would you li-

Micheal R.: I will contact you when she is free.

Doctor: But of course sir... Have a good day.
